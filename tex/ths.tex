\cvitem{title}{\emph{A Brain-Computer Interfaced Affectively-Driven Soundtrack Generator}}
\cvitem{supervisors}{Prof. Giuseppe Boccignone}\cvitem{}{Prof. Eduardo Reck Miranda}
\cvitem{languages}{OpenViBE, Python}
\cvitem{description}{The purpose of this project was to develop an intelligent system that could automatically generate a soundtrack using electrical information detected from the brain while the subject watchies a movie. The generated music should reflect the affective state of the subject.}

\subsection{Bachelor thesis}
\cvitem{title}{\emph{Separation and Classification of Acoustic Events in a Stereo Scene}}
\cvitem{supervisors}{Prof. Luca Andrea Ludovico}\cvitem{}{Dr. Giorgio Presti}
\cvitem{language}{Matlab}
\cvitem{description}{The goal was to develop a system that could separate and then classify overlapping environmental sounds in a stereo signal. The source separation is approached as a clustering problem, using Gaussian Mixture Models over the Bivariate Mixture Space. The classifier is a Naive-Bayes predictor that uses GMMs as a PDF estimator over cepstral features.}
